        My name is Tiffany Brown and my goal is to work as a <b>Full Stack Developer</b>. I want to work as a Full Stack Developer because the work is:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Future/recession proof</li>
        <li>Well paid in all parts of the country/world</li>
        <li>Flexible and remote friendly</li>
        <li>Challenging and interesting</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In addition to the above reasons, I can work as a Full Stack Developer in almost any field and I can build on my skills allowing me to move into other areas of tech, such as Cyber Security.
